description: How to use the Foundation-1 (Foundation_1.safetensors) text-to-sample music generation model for structured audio sample generation. Use this skill whenever the user wants to generate music samples, loops, or audio using Foundation-1, needs help writing prompts for the model, wants to understand the model's tag system (instruments, timbre, FX, notation), needs guidance on setup, hardware requirements, BPM/bar timing, or anything related to Foundation-1 inference and production workflows. Also use when the user mentions "Foundation-1", "Foundation_1.safetensors", "stable-audio-tools with Foundation", or "text-to-sample generation". Do NOT trigger for general music production questions unrelated to Foundation-1, or for other audio generation models (e.g., MusicGen, AudioLDM).

# Foundation-1 Usage Guide

Foundation-1 is a structured **text-to-sample diffusion model** fine-tuned from `stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0`. It generates musically coherent, production-ready audio loops from layered text prompts. It is NOT a general-purpose music generator or a drum/percussion model — it is specifically designed for **sample-generation workflows** used in modern music production.

The model file is `Foundation_1.safetensors` and its configuration is `model_config.json`, both located in the `Foundation-1/` directory (relative to the workspace root).

## When This Skill Is Triggered

Follow these guidelines based on the user's request type:

- **Setup / Installation** — First check if `Foundation-1/Foundation_1.safetensors` and `Foundation-1/model_config.json` exist in the workspace. Guide the user through RC Fork installation if needed.
- **Prompt writing** — Generate 2–3 prompt candidates using the tag system below. Explain why each tag was chosen and what sonic character it targets.
- **Programmatic usage** — Provide a working Python snippet using the API pattern in the Programmatic Usage Example section.
- **Troubleshooting** — Start by verifying the BPM/Bar/`seconds_total` timing alignment, then check prompt structure.
- **General questions** — Answer using the reference material in this skill. Point the user to `Foundation-1/Master_Tag_Reference.md` for the full tag list.

## Setup

### Required Files

Two files are needed to run the model:
- `Foundation_1.safetensors` — the model weights (16-bit, ~2.3 GB)
- `model_config.json` — the model architecture configuration

### Recommended Interface

The model is designed to work with **RC Stable Audio Tools (Enhanced Fork)**, which provides automatic timing alignment, random prompt generation aligned with training tags, and automatic MIDI extraction.

- **RC Fork**: https://github.com/RoyalCities/RC-stable-audio-tools
- **Original**: https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools

### Setup Steps (RC Enhanced Fork)

1. Clone and install the RC Stable Audio Tools fork
2. Create a subfolder inside the `models` directory
3. Place `Foundation_1.safetensors` and `model_config.json` inside that folder
4. Launch the interface
5. Select the model from the UI

### Hardware Requirements

- **GPU VRAM**: ~7 GB during generation; a GPU with **at least 8 GB VRAM** is recommended
- **Generation Speed**: ~7–8 seconds per sample on an RTX 3090

### Model Architecture (for programmatic usage)

- **Type**: `diffusion_cond` (conditional diffusion transformer)
- **Sample Rate**: 44,100 Hz
- **Audio Channels**: 2 (Stereo)
- **Sample Size**: 882,000 samples (~20 seconds max)
- **Text Encoder**: `t5-base` (max length **128 tokens** — prompts exceeding this will be truncated; keep prompts concise)
- **Conditioning**: prompt (text), seconds_start (number), seconds_total (number)
- **Diffusion backbone**: DiT with 24 layers, 24 attention heads, 1536 embedding dim

When using programmatically (e.g., via `stable-audio-tools` Python API), set:
- `seconds_start`: 0
- `seconds_total`: the calculated duration based on BPM and bar count (see Timing Reference below)

### Programmatic Usage Example

```python
import json
import torch
import torchaudio
from stable_audio_tools.models.factory import create_model_from_config
from stable_audio_tools.models.utils import load_ckpt_state_dict, copy_state_dict
from stable_audio_tools.inference.generation import generate_diffusion_cond

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

# 1. Load config and create model
with open("Foundation-1/model_config.json") as f:
    model_config = json.load(f)

model = create_model_from_config(model_config)
copy_state_dict(model, load_ckpt_state_dict("Foundation-1/Foundation_1.safetensors"))
model = model.to(device)

# 2. Calculate duration: 8 bars at 140 BPM = (8 × 4 × 60) / 140 ≈ 13.7s
conditioning = [{
    "prompt": "Synth Lead, Warm, Silky, Arp, Medium Reverb, 8 Bars, 140 BPM, F minor",
    "seconds_start": 0,
    "seconds_total": 13.7
}]

# 3. Generate (different seeds produce different musical variations)
output = generate_diffusion_cond(
    model,
    conditioning=conditioning,
    sample_size=model_config["sample_size"],
    seed=42  # Change seed for different variations with the same timbre
)

torchaudio.save("output.wav", output.squeeze(0).cpu(), model_config["sample_rate"])
```

> **Note**: The same prompt with a different `seed` will produce different melodic/musical content while maintaining the same timbral character. This is useful for generating multiple variations of a sound.

---

## Prompt Structure

Foundation-1 uses a **layered prompt system** with comma-separated tags. The order of tags is flexible, but a good structure to follow is:

```
[Instrument Family / Sub-Family], [Timbre Tags], [Musical Behavior / Notation], [FX Tags], [Bar Count], [BPM], [Key]
```

### Prompting Best Practices

1. **Start with a clear instrument identity** — use a Major Family name (e.g., `Synth`, `Keys`, `Bass`) or a more specific Sub-Family (e.g., `Synth Lead`, `Grand Piano`, `FM Bass`)
2. **Add 1–3 timbre descriptors** to shape the sonic character (e.g., `Warm, Thick, Gritty`)
3. **Include a notation/structure term** for musical coherence (e.g., `Melody`, `Chord Progression`, `Arp`)
4. **Add FX tags sparingly** — start minimal, then layer more as you learn the model (e.g., `Medium Reverb`, `Low Distortion`)
5. **Always include Bar Count and BPM** — these define the loop structure (e.g., `8 Bars, 140 BPM`)
6. **Always include a Key** — e.g., `C minor`, `F# major`, `Bb minor`
7. **Ensure generation duration matches the musical structure** — see the Timing Reference section
8. **Use `Dry` / `Wet` to control overall FX processing** — `Dry` encourages minimal, clean output; `Wet` encourages more processed, spatial, effected sounds. Use `Wet` together with specific FX tags for best results
9. **Keep prompts under ~25 tags** — the T5 encoder has a 128-token limit; overly long prompts may get truncated

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Natural language sentences**: `"Play a warm piano melody in C minor"` — the model was not trained on natural language captions
- ✅ **Structured tags instead**: `Grand Piano, Warm, Melody, 8 Bars, 120 BPM, C minor`
- ❌ **Missing BPM/Bars**: `Synth Lead, Warm, Arp, F minor` — without timing info the loop structure will be undefined
- ❌ **Duration mismatch**: requesting `8 Bars, 100 BPM` (needs 19.2s) but setting `seconds_total` to 10 — output will be incoherent
- ❌ **Requesting drums**: `Drum Kit, Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat` — percussion is outside the model's training scope
- ❌ **Genre-based prompting**: `Lo-fi hip hop beat` — only `Dubstep` and `Chiptune` exist as genre-adjacent tags, and they reinforce waveform behaviors rather than genre style

### Example Prompts

**Acid Bass**:
```
Bass, FM Bass, Medium Delay, Medium Reverb, Low Distortion, Phaser, Sub Bass, Acid, Gritty, Wide, Dubstep, Thick, Silky, Warm, Rich, Overdriven, Crisp, Deep, Clean, Pitch Bend, 303, 8 Bars, 140 BPM, E minor

## Timing Reference

The model generates loops that must match a specific relationship between **BPM**, **Bar Count**, and **Generation Duration (seconds_total)**.

If the generation duration is too short for the requested bars/BPM, the output will be incoherent. The RC Fork handles this automatically, but for programmatic use, calculate:

```
duration_seconds = (bars × beats_per_bar × 60) / BPM
```

Where `beats_per_bar` = 4 (standard 4/4 time).

### Supported BPM and Duration Table

| BPM | 4 Bars (seconds) | 8 Bars (seconds) |
|-----|------------------|------------------|
| 100 | 9.6 | 19.2 |
| 110 | 8.7 | 17.5 |
| 120 | 8.0 | 16.0 |
| 128 | 7.5 | 15.0 |
| 130 | 7.4 | 14.8 |
| 140 | 6.9 | 13.7 |
| 150 | 6.4 | 12.8 |

**Supported bar lengths**: 4 Bars, 8 Bars
**Supported BPMs**: 100, 110, 120, 128, 130, 140, 150

**Maximum generation length**: ~20 seconds (882,000 samples at 44.1 kHz)

### Key and Mode Support

- All **major keys** (C major, C# major, D major, ..., B major)
- All **minor keys** (C minor, C# minor, D minor, ..., B minor)
- **Enharmonic equivalents** are supported (e.g., `Db major` = `C# major`, `Bb minor` = `A# minor`)

**Key timbral categories**:
- **Spectral/Frequency**: Upper Mids, Mids, Highs, Low Mids, Bass, Sub Bass
- **Character**: Warm, Bright, Dark, Cold, Rich, Clean, Gritty, Smooth, Crisp
- **Spatial**: Wide, Near, Far, Spacey, Ambient, Intimate, Big, Small
- **Texture**: Thick, Thin, Fat, Silky, Airy, Soft, Punchy, Tight
- **Synthesis**: Saw, Square, Sine, Triangle, Pulse, Analog, Digital, Retro, Chiptune, 303, 808
- **Specialty**: Metallic, Glassy, Woody, Noisy, Buzzy, Growl, Breathy, Nasal, Dreamy, Sparkly, Formant Vocal

### Layer 4: FX Tags

Processing effects applied to the sound:

- **Reverb**: Low Reverb, Medium Reverb, High Reverb, Plate Reverb
- **Delay**: Low Delay, Medium Delay, High Delay, Ping Pong Delay, Stereo Delay, Cross Delay, Mono Delay
- **Distortion**: Low Distortion, Medium Distortion, High Distortion
- **Modulation**: Phaser, Low Phaser, Medium Phaser, High Phaser
- **Bit Effects**: Bitcrush, High Bitcrush

### Layer 5: Notation / Musical Structure Tags

Control the musical behavior and phrasing:

- **Harmonic**: Chord Progression, Alternating
- **Rhythmic**: Triplets, Bassline, Choppy, Rolling, Staccato, Strummed, Sustained
- **Direction**: Rising, Falling
- **Speed**: Slow Speed, Fast Speed (or just Slow, Fast)
- **Character**: Pitch Bend

---

## Timbral Mixing

One of Foundation-1's unique strengths is **timbral hybridization** — combining an instrument identity with timbre tags from a different sonic domain to create novel sounds:

- `Flute, Metallic, Gritty` — a flute with an unusual metallic edge
- `Piano, Spacey, Ambient, Wide` — a piano that feels atmospheric rather than intimate
- `Bass, Glassy, Bright, Airy` — a bass with an unexpectedly delicate character

Because instrument identity and timbre were trained as separate layers, you can freely mix and match to explore sounds that don't exist in traditional instrument libraries.

---

## Limitations

- **No percussion/drums** — the model is not trained on drum sounds
- **Only 2 genre tags exist** (Dubstep, Chiptune) — they reinforce waveform behaviors, not genre captioning
- **Structured prompts outperform natural language** — use the tag system, not sentences
- **Some timbre tags are stronger than others** — iterate to find the right balance
- **Duration must match the bar/BPM structure** — otherwise output will be incoherent
- **16-bit model only** — no quality loss compared to 32-bit
- **T5 token limit** — prompts are capped at 128 tokens; excessive tags will be truncated silently

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Output sounds incoherent or cut off | `seconds_total` is too short for the BPM/bar combination | Use the timing formula or table to set the correct duration |
| Output ignores some tags | Prompt exceeds 128 T5 tokens | Reduce the number of tags; prioritize instrument + key timbre descriptors |
| Output sounds generic | Too few descriptive tags | Add 2–3 timbre tags and a notation/structure tag |
| Unexpected tonal character | Conflicting timbre tags (e.g., `Warm` + `Cold`) | Remove contradictory descriptors; iterate with fewer tags first |
| No musical variation | Using same seed | Change the `seed` parameter for different melodic variations |
